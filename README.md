<h1>NoTorch</h1>

A 'from scratch' implementation of a deep learning library (no pytorch/tensorflow) built only on NumPy.

Heavily inspired by and based on:

https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd

Just like micrograd, this project contains a gradient engine and a small neural network library

Additional features include:

- Differentiable operations on matrices, instead of scalars
- log, exp, sigmoid

IN PROGRESS:

- Convolutional layers for CNN's
- Attention layers for Transformers
- GPU support via CuPy
