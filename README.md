<h1>NoTorch</h1>

A 'from scratch' implementation of a deep learning library (no pytorch/tensorflow) built only on NumPy.

Heavily inspired by and based on:

https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd


The structure of the grad engine in this project is similar to micrograd, with a key difference: differentiable operations with matrices instead of scalars
