<h1>NoTorch</h1>

A 'from scratch' implementation of a deep learning library (no pytorch/tensorflow) built only on NumPy.

This is a learning project heavily inspired by and based on:

https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd

Just like micrograd, this project contains a gradient engine and a neural network library

Additional features include:

- Differentiable operations on Tensors (matrices), instead of scalars
- Efficient log, sigmoid, relu, concatenation, and summation

IN PROGRESS:

- Convolutional layers for CNN's
- Attention layers for Transformers
- GPU support via CuPy


<h1>Implementation Details</h1>

Coming soon
